# K-means
K means clustering algorithm to analyze Khamti phonetic data.

This program is built to analyze 2 dimensional data. The set of data containing x and y coordinates represent the first and second formants respectively. These formants are 2 of 7 total acoustic measures for vowel measurement. The data is given in hertz. The Khamti language has 14 total vowels, and could see an output with k=14 with this code. However, with only 2 out of 7 data sets available, an accurate centroid grouping cannot be shown as we would require a program that handles 7 dimensional data.
